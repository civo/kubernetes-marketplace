## EnRoute-OneStep Kubernetes Native API Gateway - An Envoy-Powered API Gateway

[EnRoute-OneStep](https://getenroute.io) is a lightweight shim on Envoy proxy that makes it extremely easy to secure and route traffic destined to microservices running inside Kubernetes Cluster.

EnRoute-OneStep can be programmed by a developer using one command. Policy Overlays provide a meschanism to Operations teams to retain control and specify shared policy.
