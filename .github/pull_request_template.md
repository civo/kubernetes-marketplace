Thank you for wanting to submit a Pull Request to the Civo Kubernetes Marketplace repository!

If your pull request is to submit a new application to the marketplace, please answer the following questions:

* [ ] Have you followed the guidelines in our Contributing document in setting up the application?
* [ ] Have you checked that the application your submission is proposing to add does not yet exist on the Marketplace, or as a pull request to be processed?
* [ ] Have you tested your application on the Civo managed Kubernetes service? Please include a screenshot.
* [ ] Can you confirm that the software you are submitting licensed for use in a publicly-available Kubernetes marketplace?
* [ ] Have you included the specific version of the application to be installed?
* [ ] Have you implemented a conformance test in `conformance.sh` as described in the [Conformance Testing Guide](CONFORMANCE_TESTING_GUIDE.md)?

If your pull request concerns an existing Marketplace application, please make sure you have:

* [ ] Notified the Maintainer of the application in this pull request so that they are aware of your proposal.
* [ ] Outlined the changes you are proposing, and the reasons these are required (e.g. stability, compatibility with new versions of Kubernetes implementations, etc).
* [ ] Tested that the application works with the proposed updates applied (including a screenshot).
* [ ] Updated the version number of the app if that has changed.
