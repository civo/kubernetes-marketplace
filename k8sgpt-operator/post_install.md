## Using k8sgpt-operator

Follow these [post-installation steps](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator/tree/v0.1.4?tab=readme-ov-file#run-the-example), where you create k8s-secret to store credentials of your LLM AI backends (it supports multiple backends like OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, etc). Later you need to create a custom resource to apply K8sGPT configuration.
